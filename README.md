*Contributor(s):* Oviya Adhan

*Premise:* Every year, middle school students around New York, NY apply to the High School for Health Professions and Human Services (HSPHS). This project explores HSPHS admissions data through correlation analysis and machine learning to uncover the factors that are most strongly associated with acceptance. By understanding which factors best predict an applicantâ€™s admission, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights to middle schools, helping educators understand how to better position their students for admission to HSPHS.


*Methodology:* Through correlation analysis and a Multiple Linear Regression Model, I aimed to find the factors that are most strongly associated with acceptance. The process included:
Exploratory Data Analysis
Model Building
Model Decomposition
Model Evaluation

*Tools:* Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciKit Learn, Matplotlib)
